# folderOrganization
Currently, its baically a python script that helps you organize your workspace. 
I usually create a lot of random and useless files while working, so i thought of developing this script. 
Its currently under dev and I am thinking to give it a GUI and add certain features like selective folder creation and directory removal as well in subsequent time.
